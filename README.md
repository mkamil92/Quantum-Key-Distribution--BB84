# Quantum Key Distribution Using the BB84 Protocol: A Simulation-Based Approach

 In the modern digital world, the security of data and communication has become a critical
 concern. People exchange personal, financial, and sensitive information over the internet every
 day. Todayâ€™s encryption systems mostly rely on mathematical algorithms that are believed
 to be hard to break. However, with the rise of quantum computing, these systems could
 become vulnerable, as quantum computers may eventually solve these problems much faster
 than classical computers. In order to deal with this risk, scientists tried to find a new way to
 protect data called Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). QKD does not rely on complex math
 but uses the laws of quantum mechanics. One of the most popular and widely studied QKD
 protocols is BB84, which was introduced by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984.
 BB84 uses quantum bits (qubits) to generate a shared key between two parties to detect any
 eavesdropping. So in this milestone, I have clearly explained how the BB84 protocol works,
 how it is considered secure, and how it can be applied in real-world scenarios. The main
 goal of this milestone is to build a strong theoretical understanding of the protocol before
 moving to the implementation phase, as understanding theoretical concepts is essential for
 implementation milestones
